# Custom Mechanical Keyboard – Raspberry Pi Pico 2W

This project is a fully custom mechanical keyboard designed and built using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W.
The hardware, firmware, PCB design, and mechanical enclosure were developed from scratch as a hands on embedded systems project.

## Hardware Specifications
- 5x7 key matrix design
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller
- I2C OLED display integration
- Rotary encoder for additional input control
- Fully 3D-printed case and keycaps

## Firmware
- Developed using CircuitPython
- Matrix scanning implementation
- USB HID keyboard functionality
- Encoder and OLED integration
- Real-time input processing

## Design & Development Process
- Parametric 3D modeling in Fusion 360
- Manual soldering and assembly
- Iterative prototyping and tolerance optimization

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project was to gain practical experience in embedded systems, PCB design, and mechanical manufacturing while integrating hardware and firmware into a fully functional custom keyboard.
